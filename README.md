##Overview

The puppetversion module for managing the upgrade/downgrade of puppet to a specified version

##Module Description

The purpose of this module is to manage puppet upgrades. This was created because performing upgrades on on some platforms and some older

with all of those edge cases, making upgrades as simple as they should be.

###Beginning with puppetversion

   puppetversion { 'version 3.4.3':
     version => '3.4.3'
   }
```
